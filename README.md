# IBM-ML-with-Python-Capstone-Project-
My capstone project for the course IBM Data Science ML with Python 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I predict whether a person pays off the loan before the due date.
All the steps from Data Preprocessing to Exploratory Data Analysis to using different types of algorithms and metrics to predict the accuracy of my built model is present.
